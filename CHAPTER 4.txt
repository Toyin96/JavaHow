ALGORITHM - Any computing problem can be solved by executing a series of actions in a specific order.

  ALGORITHM IS A procedure for solving a problem in terms of
1. the actions to execute and
2. the order in which these actions execute

Consider the “rise-and-shine algorithm” followed by one executive for getting out of bed and going to work: 

(1) Get out of bed; 
 (2) take off pajamas; 
  (3) take a shower; 
   (4) get dressed; 
    (5) eat breakfast; 
     (6) carpool to work. 

This routine gets the executive to work well prepared to make critical decisions.

Specifying the order in which statements (actions) execute in a program is called program control.

Pseudocode is an informal language that helps you develop algorithms without having to worry about the strict details of Java language syntax. 

Normally, statements in a program are executed one after the other in the order in which they’re written. This process is called sequential execution.
